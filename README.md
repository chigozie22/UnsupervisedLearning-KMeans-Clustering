# UnsupervisedLearning-KMeans-Clustering
A machine Learning Project to find cluster patterns in species of Penguins from the Artic Region

This is also part of the projects on DataCamp Data Science series. It provides simple and clear understanding of dimensionality reduction using sklearn decomposition library: PCA and clustering using KMeans. You will also find some tricky preprocessing skills.
